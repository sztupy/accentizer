Accentizer
==========

Accentizer is a small python script that will use FontForge's engine to add
missing accented characters to fonts. It has some additional logic to create
double acute acents for ő,ű,Ő,Ű, even if a double acute modifier is not present
in the font. 

How it works
------------

Accentizer will use FontForge's accent builder, to create the missing
characters. By default it will only create the glyphs ő,Ő,ű and Ű, ut this list
can be modified by adding your desired unicode codepoints to the `glyphs` list.

Next Accentizer will run FontForge's accent builder for all the fonts that are
mentioned. For double acute characters, it will even do some extra work, if the
"double acute modifier" codepoint is not present in the font.

In the latter case it will first try to create a "double acute modifier" glyph
from a single "acute" glyph. But if the single "acute" glyph is also not
present, it will try to create one from the "é" glyph (é was chosen, as it is
a common character in French language, so support for it in fonts is higher
then for other acute characters, like á or í). If there is no "é" glyph
however, it will silently fail.

Installation
------------

Install FontForge from http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/

Windows builds can be found at https://fontforge.org/en-US/downloads/windows-dl/

After installing fontforge you can run the script using fontforge. For example
on Windows you can write:

    fontforge.bat accentizer.py Lato-Black.ttf

There is also an option to run this using docker. See `Usage` for more information.

Example result
--------------

This is a result of running Accentizer on some random fonts from Google Web
Fonts

Usage
-----

To run natively:

    accentizer.py [options] {filename}

or

    fontforge accentizer.py [options] {filename}

You can also use the attached dockerfile to get accentizer running, e.g:

    docker run -v ${PWD}:/fonts sztupy/accentizer convert /fonts/<name_of_font>.ttf

The container also hosts a small webserver you can use to convert files

    docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -ti sztupy/accentizer
    curl -v -X POST -F file=input.ttf 127.0.0.1:8080/accentize --output output.ttf

Options
-------

* `--ffont` generate accented fonts even if they claim to exist in font
* `--faccent` generate double acute from single acute even if there is a double
acute modifier present
* `--trans=xx` translate double accents closer by xx pixels when double acute
was generated from single acute. Default: 40
